			<h2 class="sectionhead">Introduction</h2>
			<br/>
			<p>3DApartment is a real estate company based in Boston, MA that provides their customers with insight to the metaverse of apartment searching. Users can visualize apartments in major cities across the country, walking throughout the virtual space as if they were there in person. The company also provides virtual art galleries for growing artists to display their work and have viewers walk through the digital space as if it were an in-person gallery. As a one-month intern for this company, I was responsible for developing a social media campaign plan for the company to market their brand. Here is a collection of the work and research I composed while working as an intern.</p>
			<hr class="newhead"/>


			<h2 class="sectionhead">Company Branding</h2>
			<br/>
			<div id="step1">
				<h5><em><strong>Competitor Research</strong></em></h5>
				<p>Other real estate companies had developed a brand name for themself, with specific user stories in mind when creating their marketing graphics. At the time of my internship, 3DAPARTMENT's social accounts lacked a sense of branding. There were no set color themes, a lack of a consistent logo, and the posts seemed to target a far too wide range of people, lifestyles, and income. Through my research of the company's values and services, I developed a brand mood board for 3DAPARTMENT to provide them with a basis of what their company's persona should depict.</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h5><em><strong>Company Mood Board</strong></em></h5>
				<div class="moodboard">
					<img src="img/3dapartment/moodboard.png" alt="3DApartment Mood Board">
				</div>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h5><em><strong>Board Explanation</strong></em></h5>
				<p>By discussing with the company their values and what they hope to provide with their services I composed a board that defines the theme of the 3DApartment company. Four colors are included as the company's primary color palette, with the green and blue color serving as secondary colors. The typefaces included can be used on websites, graphic posts, emails, and more in order to help establish a brand name. The images included help to define the 'mood' of the company as homey, but a bit more on the upper-class side being that the apartments offered are in major urban cities across the country, not rural areas.</p>
			</div>

			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<div id="step2">
				<h2 class="sectionhead">Graphic Posts</h2>
				<br/>
				<h5><em><strong>User Research</strong></em></h5>
				<div class="graph-text-3d">
					<p>When designing the graphic posts for social media, I first researched the target audience in order to maximize the effectiveness of the designs. I looked into social media platform data, specifically Instagram, and analyzed the demographics of the most frequent users. I found that <strong>people aged 18-34</strong> make up more than <strong>61% of Instagram users</strong>, making Generation Z and Millennials the primary target audience. These two groups are also the same groups who are the most likely to be purchasing apartments, allowing Instagram to be a very effective platform to market the 3DAPARTMENT brand name.</p><br/>

			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<div id="step3">
				<h5><em><strong>Post Examples</strong></em></h5>
				<div class="designs">

						<h5>Instagram Reel Example</h5>

					</div>
				</div>
				<br/>
				<p>These posts were each created to provide an example of each post type for the company. Instagram posts are often more complex, with the ability to include up to 10 different slides and a caption. Instagram stories are typically understood through visuals due to its short duration, giving them the ability to be posted more frequently. Finally, Instagram Reels allow for a longer, descriptive video to be viewed and are often posted less frequently due to their length.<br/><br/>These posts were given to the company, in addition to a general plan moving forward on how to further the branding of the company and how to extend brand name awareness through scheduled social posts. Collaborating with influencers or other growing companies on certain posts and interacting with followers in the comments was also advised.</p>
